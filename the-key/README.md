> Some say a programmer’s best solution is a simple two-step process: copy and paste. On April 1st, 2021, Stack Overflow proved it. On that fateful day, each time users went to copy a piece of code, they were met with a pop-up for a fake product. It was called The Key: an ultra-compact macropad advertised as the new (and only) way to copy and paste on the platform. As it turns out, roughly one fourth of Stack Overflow’s 15 million users tries to copy and paste within five minutes of visiting the site. An even greater number saw the joke and loved it, with many demanding that The Key be developed in earnest. So, naturally, we teamed up with Stack Overflow to make it happen. What started as an April Fool’s gag is now a full-fledged macropad—designed by our very own community member Cassidy, with a portion of proceeds benefiting digitalundivided.
