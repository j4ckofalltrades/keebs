Modified version of default Via-compatible keymap plus some Vim-inspired features
e.g. soft escape (Esc when held, Ctrl when tapped),

and media controls.

## Layout

Standard 75% layout except `Caps Lock` is remapped as "soft escape" (Esc when held, Ctrl when tapped), and the addition

of media controls in Layer 1. 


## Features

- Mode for soft escape (`Esc` when tapped, `Ctrl` when held) 
- Media player controls
